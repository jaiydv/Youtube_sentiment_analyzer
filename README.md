This platform, built using HTML, CSS, and Flask, provides an intuitive interface for analyzing emotions and sentiments from YouTube comments. Users can input a YouTube video link along with the number of comments they wish to analyze. The platform automatically extracts the specified number of comments and applies a state-of-the-art RoBERTa (Robustly Optimized BERT Pretraining Approach) model to evaluate and generate a comprehensive report on the emotions conveyed in the comments. 

### Key Features:
- **User Input:** Easy-to-use form where users provide a YouTube link and select how many comments to analyze.
- **Sentiment and Emotion Analysis:** The platform leverages RoBERTa to detect a wide range of emotions, offering deeper insights into how viewers feel about the video content.
- **Detailed Reports:** Users receive a detailed breakdown of the emotions, including visualizations, to better understand the audience's reactions.

This tool is designed to help content creators, marketers, and researchers gain a deeper understanding of audience sentiment and tailor their strategies accordingly.
